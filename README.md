This is supposed to be a starting point where you can start writing code without having to setup a ton of shit.

### How do I use this?

 - Run `npm install`.
 - Open this directory in Visual Studio Code.
 - Run the Build Task (`Cmd + Shift + P -> Tasks: Run Build Task` or just `Cmd + Shift + B`) which will start Webpack Dev Server.
 - Browse to http://localhost:8080/

### How do I add more dependencies?
`npm install <whatever>`, same rules as webpack projects apply.

### What about React etc.?
Its left as an excersize for the reader.
